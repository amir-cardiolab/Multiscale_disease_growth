# Multiscale_disease_growth
Multiscale modeling of cardiovascular disease growth coupling organ-scale mechanics and cell-scale biology

This software contains 3 different folders for different examples for multiscale modeling of growth and remodeling coupling organ-scale and cell signaling pathways. 

Here, you can find the toturial for the software here:

Also you can download the folder named fenics_software which included 3 different examples of growth for cube, tube and aortic valve. 

Finally, the cube and tube geometries can be created in the code, but for aortic valve geometry you can use the link below from google drive to download the geometry:
